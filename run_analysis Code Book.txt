This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidySet2.txt.
Other details about the project can be found in the Readme.txt file. 

Identifiers used in order to merge the data files:

subjectid - The ID of the test subject (1 to 30)
activityid -  The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
Measurements (1 to 6)
activityType - the description provided for each activity_id (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

NOTE: The details of the measurements can be found in features_info.txt file.

Activity Labels are as followed:
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

The analysis output,  "tidySet2.txt", contains the aggregated average for each of the above measures 
for each subject and each activity.
